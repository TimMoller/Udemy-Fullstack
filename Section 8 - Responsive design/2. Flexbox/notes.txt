What is Flexbox?

Flexbox is a method in css that can reposition element set as boxes.

When designing a website, it is best practice to approach it from a mobile first perspective. Build the pages for mobile firs and then go bigger for desktop devices.

Open the flex:

Element{
    Display: flex;
}

You can then use various other flex transformations:

flex-direction: row;
flex-direction: row-reverse;
flex-direction: column;
flex-direction: column-reverse;

Justify-content: centre;
Justify-content: space-around;
Justify-content: space-between;
Justify-content: space-evenly;

When using Flexbox, you are working again with parent elements to effect the positioning of the elements within.
